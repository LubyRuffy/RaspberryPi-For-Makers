# RaspberryPi-For-Makers

RaspberryPi-For-Makers source code
----------------------------------

Sample Source Codes are for the book "Raspberry Pi for Makers" published by Insite(Korean Publisher).
Sources codes are mainly python 2.X codes, but I made some C codes too for the developers who use wiringPi or pigpio library.

If you have any questions, please contact me(raspberry.pi.maker@gmail.com).
And If I find some mistakes of the book, I'll let you know by this notes [errfix.md](https://github.com/raspberry-pi-maker/RaspberryPi-For-Makers/blob/master/errfix.md).
